displayed in page/column footers when page/column breaks are introduced by 
stretching bands which are prevented from splitting;

- inhibit the creation of new page/column when the current page/column is already 
new and thus avoid creating empty pages/columns in various cases where features 
for controlling page/column breaks were involved;

- added more test reports to document the changes in the way band evaluation and 
page/column breaks work;

- minor bug fixes and improvements;





JasperReports 6.4.3 (2017-10-16)
---------------------------------------------

- removed JExcelApi dependency and the deprecated source code using it, 
including exporters, data sources and query executers;

<property> element, instead of the usual value attribute of the element;

- minor bug fixes and improvements;





JasperReports 6.3.1 (2016-10-03)
---------------------------------------------

- new JSONQL query language with advanced syntax for queries and for field mapping 
expressions to allow more complex field mapping scenarios including the ability to map 
fields to the parent node values; this new query language and its respective query executer, 
which offers XPath-like capabilities, deprecate the existing JSON query language and 
the former query executer;

- support for request headers was added to HTTP data adapters as well as improved 
parameter mapping using custom parameter properties to markup dataset parameters which 
contribute to the HTTP request; the new sample under /demo/samples/httpdataadapters shows 
some of these improvements;

- new evaluationTime attribute added to dataset parameter definition to control the exact 
moment when the default value expression of the parameter is evaluated; the default evaluation 
time for parameters which do not specify a value for the attribute is controlled using the
net.sf.jasperreports.parameter.evaluation.time configuration property;

- support for property expressions added for dataset fields to allow more flexibility in 
data source and query executer field mapping;

- the use of the fieldDescription attribute in data source and query executer field mapping 
is now deprecated by the introduction of special field level custom properties for each type 
of data source and query executer;

- support for property expressions in dataset was added to allow more flexibility in dataset 
and report configuration, including the ability to control export properties using report parameters; 
the report and dataset property expressions can be evaluated at different moments and this is 
controlled by the their evaluationTime attribute; when evaluationTime attribute is not specified 
for a property expression, it defaults to the value specified by the 
net.sf.jasperreports.property.evaluation.time configuration property;

- multiple chart customizer objects can be registered per chart element using new configuration 
properties having the net.sf.jasperreports.customizer.class.{arbitrary_name} format;

customizers which are ready to use in reports;

- the data adapter extension is now enabled by default in all JasperReports deployments;

- the XLS, XLSX, DOCX and PPTX exporters were enhanced to support specifying metadata 
information such as title, subject, author, keywords and creator application for the 
generated documents using export configuration properties;

- minor bug fixes and improvements;





JasperReports 6.3.0 (2016-06-20)
---------------------------------------------

- upgrade to Java 7; starting with this release, the binary distribution of the JR library
is compiled for the Java 7 platform and is no longer guaranteed to be compatible with Java 6;

- deprecation of DTD based validation for style template files (*.jrtx) and introduction of 
XML schema based validation;

- minor bug fixes and improvements;





JasperReports 6.2.2 (2016-05-06)
---------------------------------------------

- adding new types of element stretch and deprecating some of the existing ones, 
to differentiate between element group stretch and container stretch and to 
also account for the current vertical displacement of the element;

- introducing new generic Renderable interface for image rendering while 
deprecating the existing one and its implementations, to better differentiate 
between static visualizations such as images, SVGs, and dynamically generated 
drawings, each identified by separate specialized renderable interface, 
with convenience implementation classes;

- built-in support for SVG as image format, including support for embedding 
SVG in HTML export;

- making use of fonts from JR font extensions when rendering SVG with Apache Batik 
as well as use of Web fonts in the SVG embedded into the HTML export;

- enhanced support for internationalization, with the addition of font set definitions 
in JR font extensions, to allow grouping font families in super-sets that can cover 
several languages/scripts; when using a font set, the font family resolution occurs 
during text processing and is performed on a per character basis, allowing mixing of words 
in different languages/scripts in the same text element;

- support for calling PL/SQL stored procedures (Oracle), which was available 
as a separate query executer extension, is now part of the JR core library;

- minor bug fixes and improvements;

the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, by adding support for making headings up to level 6, 
marking lists and automatic insertion of table markers for table component output;

- support for complex scripts (such as Indic scripts) in PDF by means of AWT text layout;

- added support for duration based filter and duration based conditional formatting of 
numeric columns in table components; special format pattern [h]:mm:ss causes numeric values 
to be treated as duration;

- refactored map component items APIs for further reuse in other custom components;

- minor bug fixes and improvements;





JasperReports 6.1.1 (2015-09-07)
---------------------------------------------

- added support for returning values from bands, which gives better control over 
variable incrementation in cases where calculations are coupled with content rendering, 
such as page totals;

- allow frame elements to be placed beyond frame bottom edge; this would cause frames 
to grow in height in order to display all their content and reduces the need for frames to
shrink in case some of their content displays conditionally and space needs to be collapsed;

- new configuration property "net.sf.jasperreports.evaluator.ignore.npe" added to control 
the expressions evaluation with respect to raising NullPointerException;

- added support for locale and timezone in CSV and XLS data adapters;

JasperReports 6.0.0 (2014-11-25)
---------------------------------------------

- new type of report template called "report book" was added, in which sections are made 
of parts instead of bands; parts are external report templates, similar to subreports, 
and allow creation of documents with variable page size and/or orientation; parts can be 
displayed on separate tabs by report viewers and simplify creation of "table of contents" 
structures in which parts that appear early in the document are actually filled/rendered 
later during the report filling process (see evaluationTime attribute of part);

- new JSON metadata exporter added, similar to the XLS and CSV metadata exporters in which 
the values that need to be exported have to be marked-up using configuration properties at 
text element level;

- upgrade to iText version 5.5.0 in the PDF exporter;

- upgrade to POI version 3.10.1 in the XLS exporter and data source;
 
- minor bug fixes and improvements;

completely removed from the library sometime in the future; The JRXlsExporter, JRXlsMetadataExporter 
(both Apache POI based) and JRXlsxExporter implementations should be used instead;

- new Apache POI based XLS report data source (XlsDataSource class), which replaces the now 
deprecated JExcelApi based data source (JRXlsDataSource class);

- new Excel data adapter implementation, with ability to auto-detect Excel file format 
(XLS 2003 or XLSX 2007); sample provided under the /demo/samples/exceldataadapter folder of 
the project source distro;

- the older HTML and XHTML exporters (JRHtmlExporter and JRXhtmlExporter) are now deprecated 
and should no longer be used as they will no longer be maintained and will be completely removed 
from the library sometime in the future; The newer HtmlExporter implementation should be used instead;

- new title cell added to crosstab element structure, to allow align content with 
dynamic width crosstabs;

- added new PDF exporter configuration properties (net.sf.jasperreports.export.pdf.permissions.allowed 
and net.sf.jasperreports.export.pdf.permissions.denied) to control PDF file permissions from 
within the report template or globally, from JasperReports configuration context; 

- support for table-of-contents metadata build-up during report filling process, to be leveraged 
in document viewers that have the ability to display bookmark based table-of-contents that are not 
part of the document content itself.

- new XMLA query executer based on olap4j;

- support for loading report resource bundles from repository;

metadata (new JSON exporter) and support for dynamically loaded Javascript modules through RequireJS. 
The new APIs simplify interactive report viewer adoption and its customization while giving 
new opportunities for creation of interactive custom components;

- interactive table component formatting capabilities extended to allow basic formatting and 
conditional formatting of all table sections including group headers and footers;

- interactive sorting introduced to the crosstab element, where crosstab data can be sorted interactively 
by row group values and/or measure values, when report is viewed with an interactive report viewer;

but still supports overlapping elements by arranging them in separate layers. 
This new exporter implemented in the net.sf.jasperreports.engine.export.HtmlExporter class also 
supports report interactivity and is now the preferred way to export to HTML, being used by 
the JasperExportManager class and all other convenience and utility classes in the JasperReports 
library and its provided samples;

- the ODS exporter refactored so that it behaves more like the XLS exporters and thus supports 
a significant number of XLS export configuration properties and parameters;

- new <hyperlinkWhenExpression> introduced for hyperlink definitions, complemented with export time 
configuration properties to control the appearance of hyperlinks depending on the export format;

- new cells available in crosstab structure, to allow defining headers for column groups in 
the top left corner of the crosstab, where the unstructured crosstab header cell is normally rendered;
 these new cells overlap the former crosstab header cell, if present, but allow for their content 
 to stretch in accordance with column group header cell stretching;

- new shared virtualizer implementation added to allow the use of a separate swap file per report; 

- added support for localization in the exceptions raised by the JasperReports library;

- added configuration properties for controlling the interactive features of the table component

---------------------------------------------

- enhanced interactivity in the table component, with support for conditional formatting 
of values in a column;

- support for style providers as pluggable extensions, to control report element styling 
depending on report data at runtime; a default style provider implementation is available, 
allowing the use of expression based custom properties at report element level, to control 
each style attribute, including backcolor, forecolor, font, borders style, etc;

- added support for markers to the built-in map component, along with other new map level 
settings such as type of map, image type and language (I18n support);

- version support added to the JRXmlWriter utility class to allow generating source JRXML format 
for older versions of the library, including support for versioning of custom components markup;

- support for custom $X{} functions in queries, which can be plugged in as extensions;

- added support for relative date ranges used as input parameters in parametrized queries;

to allow for variable page size in PDF documents, by adapting page size to page content size;

- better control over memory footprint in large XLSX exports, by allowing the temporary files buffer size
to be configured locally through report custom properties;

- minor bug fixes and improvements;





JasperReports 4.6.0 (2012-05-21, SVN 5400)
---------------------------------------------

- improved JasperReports configuration infrastructure by the introduction of a JasperReportsContext, 
an new interface from where JR configuration properties are read and JR extensions are loaded.
This allows different configurations of the JR engine to exist simultaneously in the same JVM;

- improved JasperReports Web Framework which now features a centralized controller to dispatch
actions triggered by end user interactions in the report viewer. Actions are backed by atomized 
commands that modify the report metadata on-the-fly, with support for undo/redo operations, 
to reflect changes in the report output;

- introduction of reusable Web report viewer APIs, featuring configurable report viewing servlets,
and built-in Javascript modules that can be used to create custom interactive report viewers in Web
applications embedding the JasperReports Library.
This is demonstrated in the new /demo/samples/webapp-repo sample where two different looking versions
of the same build-in JR interactive report viewer are used to displays interactive reports;

- enhanced interactivity in the table component, with support for column formatting, hiding, resizing,
moving, sorting and filtering, all leveraging the new action-based JR Web Framework controller and its 
interactivity supporting report viewer Javascript APIs;

- introduction of a data caching API that helps avoid re-querying the report's data source, 
for performance reasons, while interactively viewing the report using an interactive report viewer
created based on the new JR Web Framework;

- added new page related events in the asynchronous report filler to support asynchronous page display
in interactive report viewers;

- added support for message providers that can be plugged into JR as extensions, to allow 
internationalization of interactive custom components UIs;

- minor bug fixes and improvements;

---------------------------------------------

- the JSON data source and the respective JSON query executer were moved 
from the samples folder to the core library;

- support for macros added in XLS and XSLX exporters;

- the repository APIs were enhanced with support for pluggable persistence 
services to load and store resources in the repository;

- the "net.sf.jasperreports.export.pdf.force.linebreak.policy" configuration 
property is un-deprecated, as a partial revert of the changes made in 4.1.1 with 
regards to PDF text rendering; These changes were partially reverted as they affected 
the performance of the PDF exporter when dealing with simple texts. The AWT-based text 
rendering is now performed only on complex text fields that contain tab characters 
for tab stop alignment or contain multiple paragraphs, with variable paragraph styling.

- minor bug fixes and improvements;





JasperReports 4.5.0 (2011-12-06, SVN 4839)
---------------------------------------------
